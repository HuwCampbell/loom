Loom is a project for developing, building and packaging web-based projects.


## Command line

```
# Build and package the required resources
loom build

# Start a running process that serves up a "live" web version of this library
# and watches the filesystem for changes
loom watch
```


## Configuration

Loom is configured via a single `loom.toml` file in the root of the project.

Other loom libraries can be referenced in the set of `dependencies`.
This will include all their components/sass files as if they were directly referenced
by _this_ project, and will be visible in the generated site.

```toml
[loom]
  # Mandatory
  version = 1

  # Mandatory
  name = "my_project"

  # Optional
  dependencies = ["lib/bikeshed"]

[components]
  # Optional
  paths = ["components/*"]

[sass]
  # Optional
  paths = ["scss/*"]
```


## Environment variables

- `LOOM_SITE_PREFIX`

  The prefix root to use for all links rendered on the generated site.
  This can be used if the site is being hosted under a sub-prefix.

  An example of this might be publishing the site for the current commit
  to `s3` to be reviewed as part of a pull request.

  Defaults to "/".


## Setting up a new Haskell project with Loom

Where `$PROJECT` is the name of your project.

1. `git submodule add git@github.com:ambiata/loom.git lib/loom`
2. `cp lib/loom/scripts/loom .`
3. `echo .loom >> .gitignore`
4. `printf "[loom]\n  version = 1\n  name = \"$PROJECT\"\n" > loom.toml`
5. Add `$PROJECT-loom` package to your cabal build-depends dependencies
6. Import `$PROJECT.Assets` into your main and compose `assetMiddleware` with your existing `Middleware`
7. Render the template html to the relevant format using
   [hydrant](http://haddock.engineering.ambiata.com/hoogle/package/ambiata-hydrant/Hydrant.html):

   ```
   import qualified Hydrant as Hydrant
   import qualified $PROJECT.Assets as Assets
   import qualified $PROJECT.Modules.Template as Template
   ...
   html =
     Hydrant.to??? . Hydrant.doctype "html" . Template.frame Assets.css $
       Template.myTemplate
   ```

   In this case `Assets.css` is a generated function with all the relevant css files.


## Prerequisites

- `sassc`

  Currently [sassc](https://github.com/sass/sassc) is required to be on the `$PATH`.
  It can be installed with one of the following options:

  - For OSX users: `brew install sassc`
  - For Arch users: `pacman -S sassc`
  - Everyone else: https://github.com/sass/sassc#documentation
