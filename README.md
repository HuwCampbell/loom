Loom is a project for developing, building and packaging web-based projects.

## Background

Currently bikeshed is the central point for the entire front-end, and has 3 separate responsibilities.

- Pattern library modules
- Application-level components
- Gulp build for generating web resource artifacts

## Requirements

From each of the top-level applications, like manor or aperture, we _must_ be able to achieve the following goals:

- Bespoke components
- Efficient completed resources
- Pattern library
   - Live and easy to change

## Layout

This would be the expected layout (either convention or possibly configuration) for the new build tool.

```
src/... .hs
lib/bikeshed/
  modules/...
  components/...
  package.json
  bower.json
components/input/
  x.scss
  x.purs
  x.js
  x-ffi.js
  README.md
  examples
  x.jpeg
  interface
package.json
bower.json
```

## Lifecycle

This is a high level flow diagram of the bikeshed gulp build.

```

## Commands

```
# Build and package the required resources
loom build

# Run any available linting
loom lint

# Run any javascript/purescript tests for this project
loom test

# Start a running process that serves up a "live" web version of this library
loom start
```

## Required executables

The current build process requires the following (additional) executable binaries.

- Purescript (currently built by bikeshed)
- Node/NPM
- Sass

## Conceptual Warriors

- Mark Hibberd
- Charles O'Farrell
