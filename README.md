Loom is a project for developing, building and packaging web-based projects.


## Command line

```
# Build and package the required resources
loom build

# Start a running process that serves up a "live" web version of this library
# and watches the filesystem for changes
loom watch
```


## Configuration

Loom is configured via a single `loom.toml` file in the root of the project.

Other loom libraries can be referenced in the set of `dependencies`.
This will include all their components/sass files as if they were directly referenced
by _this_ project, and will be visible in the generated site.

Javascript and Purescript files inside components will be
automatically discovered and added to a `main` bundle.
Users can also specify custom JS bundles. An example `first` bundle is
provided below.

Javascript dependencies can be sourced from the NPM registry, but we
require the SHA1 hash of each dependencys source tarball alongside its
version tag. This will be validated on fetch to catch unexpected
upstream changes. Dependency tarballs will be cached in `$HOME/.loom`.

Javascript and Purescript dependencies can also be sourced from Github
using a repository identifier, a Git ref, and the source tarball's
SHA1 hash.

```toml
[loom]
  # Mandatory
  version = 1

  # Mandatory
  name = "my_project"

  # Optional
  dependencies = ["lib/bikeshed"]

[components]
  # Optional
  paths = ["components/*"]

[sass]
  # Optional
  paths = ["scss/*"]

[js]
  # Optional
  paths = [
      "app/src/js/common/*"
    ]

[js.bundle.first]
  # Optional
  main = "app/src/js/first.js"
  paths = [
      "app/src/js/first/*"
    ]

[js.dependencies]
  # Optional
  npm = [
      ["d3", "4.7.4", "a2f40eb57decc51bc469010d48ae74a20e025772"]
    ]
  github = [
      ["isaacs/rimraf", "tags/v2.6.1", "813139ac3628ae0b47136de18939cbb623e21475"]
    ]

[purs]
  # Optional
  paths = [
      "app/src/purs"
    ]

[purs.dependencies]
  # Optional
  github = [
      ["purescript/purescript-newtype", "tags/v2.0.0", "2276bd44ff5b7440c455839833c69f40cc8d8616"]
    ]
```


## Environment variables

- `LOOM_SITE_PREFIX`

  The prefix root to use for all links rendered on the generated site.
  This can be used if the site is being hosted under a sub-prefix.

  An example of this might be publishing the site for the current commit
  to `s3` to be reviewed as part of a pull request.

  Defaults to "/".


## Setting up a new Haskell project with Loom

Where `$PROJECT` is the name of your project.

1. `git submodule add git@github.com:ambiata/loom.git lib/loom`
2. `cp lib/loom/scripts/loom .`
3. `echo .loom >> .gitignore`
4. `printf "[loom]\n  version = 1\n  name = \"$PROJECT\"\n" > loom.toml`
5. Add `$PROJECT-loom` package to your cabal build-depends dependencies
6. Import `$PROJECT.Assets` into your main and compose `assetMiddleware` with your existing `Middleware`
7. Render the template html to the relevant format using
   [hydrant](http://haddock.engineering.ambiata.com/hoogle/package/ambiata-hydrant/Hydrant.html):

   ```
   import qualified Hydrant as Hydrant
   import qualified $PROJECT.Assets as Assets
   import qualified $PROJECT.Modules.Template as Template
   ...
   html =
     Hydrant.to??? . Hydrant.doctype "html" . Template.frame Assets.css $
       Template.myTemplate
   ```

   In this case `Assets.css` is a generated function with all the relevant css files.


## Prerequisites

- `sassc`

  Currently [sassc](https://github.com/sass/sassc) is required to be
  on the `$PATH`.
  It can be installed with one of the following options:

  - For OSX users: `brew install sassc`
  - For Arch users: `pacman -S sassc`
  - Everyone else: https://github.com/sass/sassc#documentation

- `node`

  Currently [node](https://nodejs.org) is required to be on the `$PATH`.
  Node is required to post-process Javascript and Purescript, and to
  run Purescript test suites. It can be installed with one of the
  following options:

  - For OSX users: `brew install node`
  - For Arch users: `pacman -S node`
  - Everyone else: https://nodejs.org/en/download
